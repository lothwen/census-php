{"name":"Census-php","body":"Census v2.0Beta\r\n==============\r\n\r\nBefore describing this software, I must say that this my first \"real\"\r\napplication written in php (in fact, it's my first serious project I've \r\nwork on). Maybe you will find bugs or errors in my code. Feel free to\r\nmail me commenting what you want to improve this piece of code.\r\n\r\n1.- Purpose\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nCensus is a php application to make scout coordinator's life easier. \r\nIt's a graphical web frontend to scout group census. With this, the\r\nchildren data will be centralized and accesible everywhere and everywhen.\r\n\r\nSincerely, I write this to learn some php programming and for helping\r\nto have my group's information more accesible to rest of monitors.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I hope to share this work with other scout groups of\r\nmy province.\r\n\r\n2.- Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRight now it supports this features. To know whay will be implemented\r\n, please see the TODO file.\r\n\r\n* Add and delete childs to the database.\r\n* Edit the data of some child.\r\n* Make searches.\r\n* Export the search results to pdf.\r\n* Export \"letter-ready\" labels to send snail-mail without any effort ;-) .\r\n\r\n3.- Downloading\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you are reading this README file, means that you have download \r\ncensus somehow. I'm using git control version software. You will\r\nfind much info in google, but if you are impacient with downloading\r\nthe latest code from upstream, you need to have installed git in \r\nyour system and clone my repo. To do this, run this command in \r\nyour terminal ::\r\n\r\n\t$ git clone git://github.com/lothwen/census-php.git\r\n\r\n4.- Installation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nTo have census running you need a LAMP (Linux Apache Mysql PHP) \r\ninstallation ready. Copy all files to your apache document root, \r\nedit includes/config.php to setup your mysql and ome various\r\nvars like debugging. The next step is to create the needed database \r\nand tables. I added a sql file in sql/ dir to only have to dump\r\nthis file into mysql. You can do this by typing in your terminal::\r\n\t\r\n\t$ mysql -u root -p < sql/data.sql\r\n\r\nNow, you will need an user and a password to enter into the app.\r\nConnect to mysql with the cli client or with phpMyadmin (or what\r\nyou use) and add a row to table \"auth\" with your wanted login\r\nuser, pass.\r\n\r\nIf you have made all fine, yo can access your web server and login\r\ninto the census. Now you can start adding children and using it :-P\r\n\r\n5.- Contributing\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nFor now you can contribute with census sending your opinions to me,\r\nmaking bug reports, sending patches, and using census.\r\n","tagline":"make scout group management easier","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
